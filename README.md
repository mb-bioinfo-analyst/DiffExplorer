## About the App

The DiffExplorer App is a web-based application that allows users to perform various data processing and visualization tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface to upload data files, apply filters, and generate interactive visualizations. The app is built using R and Python, leveraging popular libraries such as Shiny and Plotly.
We are working to make this as a desktop application for windows, mac and linux, not to forget making a lighter version for mobile platforms such as android and ios.

## Features

- Data upload: Users can upload data files in .hcdiff format or choose from example data.
- Data filtering: Users can apply filters to select specific data subsets for analysis.
- Interactive visualizations: The app provides interactive charts and tables for data exploration.
- Export options: Users can download filtered data or visualizations in various formats such as CSV and Excel.
